# Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. We will explore the fundamental principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, understanding the transition from AI models confined to digital environments to intelligent systems that operate in physical space.

## Focus and Theme
This book focuses on **AI Systems in the Physical World** and **Embodied Intelligence**.

## Goal
The primary goal is **Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body**. Students will apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1-2): Introduction to Physical AI
- Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of humanoid robotics landscape

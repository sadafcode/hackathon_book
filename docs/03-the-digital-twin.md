# The Digital Twin (Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity)

This chapter focuses on creating digital twins of robots using simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity. Students will learn to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions, and build high-fidelity environments for human-robot interaction.

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Focus:** Physics simulation and environment building.
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 6-7): Robot Simulation with Gazebo
- Gazebo simulation environment setup
- URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Physics simulation and sensor simulation
- Introduction to Unity for robot visualization

# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 Fundamentals)

This chapter delves into the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for robotic control. Students will master ROS 2 for robotic control, understanding its architecture and core concepts to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Focus:** Middleware for robot control.
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy.
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 3-5): ROS 2 Fundamentals
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management
